		In their Web Programming Class at Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013, four great minds came together to code a web application for their final project. The premise was simple: create a product pertaining to, or complementing, vehicles. In the small kitchen of Tufts University's Halligan Hall, the concept of Road Trip Radio was born. Several late nights later, they are proud to present you with their final product.
